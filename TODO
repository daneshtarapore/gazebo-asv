- Collision shape of mono-hull ASV. Currently there is a bug in collisions between ASVs -- they pass through each other.  

- Sensor plugins for the ASV: compass, GPS position sensor and Wi-Fi communication module.

- Model plugin for the ASV controller

- Extending the world with a swarm of ASVs 

- Calibrate the mono-hull ASV hydrodynamic parameters of linear damping. Use trajectory logs of the physical ASV from https://zenodo.org/record/45570#.V_tuj5MrKEI
